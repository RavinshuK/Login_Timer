I have manually added two users to the Django admin database:

User1: Ravinshu (Superuser)
Pass: Dagger01

User2: Rishu
Pass: Dagger02

You can access the django admin database using the superuser.


NOTE: The logout notification shows the logged in time of the user in minutes and seconds, although it is stored in seconds
      in the database. It can be modified/changed in the future according to the requirement.
      Also I have stored the output images in the static folder.
